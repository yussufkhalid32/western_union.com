For transactions sent, EPL generally means any Agent location in the destination country You identify. The Services offered by Telecomunicaciones de Mexico (“Telecomm”) are only available at Telecomm locations. Receiver will normally receive funds in cash, check, or a combination thereof; with some Services, funds may be credited to a bank account, prepaid, debit or credit card (“Card(s)”), mobile wallet (“MWallet(s)”), or similar account (collectively, “Account(s)”). Receiver may be able to elect a payout method that differs from the payout method You specify; You authorize WU to honor Receiver’s election of payout method. Receivers who choose to receive funds through a payout method other than cash or in a currency other than the one You selected may incur additional fees to access funds. Certain countries and/or jurisdictions may impose a tax, fee and/or tariff on Receiver’s receipt of, or access to, transferred funds. Transactions may be reported to applicable authorities. Messaging and notification services may be included for additional fees. In some destinations Receiver may be required to provide identification, a test question answer or both to receive funds in cash. Test questions are not an additional security feature and cannot be used to time or delay the payment of a transaction and are prohibited in certain countries. WU RELIES ON THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US TO SEND MONEY. PLEASE REVIEW ALL TRANSACTION DETAILS FOR ACCURACY BEFORE CONTINUING YOUR TRANSACTION.\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp \u003e\u003cb\u003e2.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE: When You send money outside the U.S., You are contracting with both WUFSI and WUIS, which are conducting two separate money transfer transactions in order to make the money available to Final Receiver. In the first transaction, You are engaging WUFSI and its Agents to collect Your money and make it available to WUIS.\u0026nbsp; In the second transaction, You are engaging WUIS to convert Your money into the correct currency and make the funds available to Final Receiver outside the U.S. In addition to the transfer fees, which are charged by WUIS, a currency exchange rate will be applied. U.S. currency is converted to foreign currency at an exchange rate set by WU unless the laws of the EPL do not permit WU to set an exchange rate. Any difference between the rate given to You and the rate received by WU will be kept by WU (and, in some cases, its Agents) in addition to the transfer fees. Subject to applicable law, the actual or estimated currency exchange rate applicable to Your transaction will be provided on the written disclosures provided to You by WU. Payouts will generally be made in the national currency of the EPL (“Local Currency”). In some countries, You may designate a payout currency other than the Local Currency; however, the alternate currency You choose may not be available at all Agent locations. WU is not responsible for the currency exchange rate that will be applied if Final Receiver chooses to receive a currency other than the currency You selected.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp \u003e\u003cb\u003e7. SPECIAL TERMS FOR TRANSACTIONS TO ACCOUNTS:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003eWhere available, WU may allow You to credit a Receiver’s Account. The Account provider may impose additional fees on Receiver for receiving the funds into an Account. Unless required by applicable law, WU accepts no responsibility to You nor to any Account holder, for any fees imposed on Receiver by the Account provider. If the currency You select to send to an Account is not the currency in which the Account is denominated, the Account provider may convert the funds at its own currency exchange rate or reject the transaction. Receiver’s agreement with the Account provider governs Receiver’s rights, liabilities and fees (including fees to transfer cash out of a Card or MWallet), and the Account provider may impose its own restrictions regarding funds availability, limits that may be transferred to or held in Accounts, hours of operations, holidays or other limitations. In most cases, Receiver must be enrolled in a Card or MWallet program in order to receive a transaction. A Receiver who is not enrolled in a Card or MWallet program may be able to receive funds at an Agent location and may be subject to additional requirements. WU may make money from fees associated with use of a Card or MWallet. Neither WU, nor its Agents, endorse or recommend the services of any Card or MWallet provider.\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp \u003e\u003cb\u003eIMPORTANT NOTICE FOR TRANSACTIONS TO “ACCOUNTS” (AS DEFINED ABOVE):\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003ePLEASE MAKE SURE THE ACCOUNT NUMBER, BANK DETAILS, CURRENCY SELECTED, AND/OR CARD OR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER ARE CORRECT BEFORE SENDING.

SPECIAL TERMS FOR TRANSACTIONS FROM ACCOUNTS:\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp;Where available, Western Union may allow You to pay for the Services by using an Account. The bank or other provider of an Account, including card issuers (the “Account Provider”) may impose additional fees on Your Account. The agreement with the Account Provider governs use of an Account and provides the rights and liabilities of the holder of the Account. Unless required by applicable law, Western Union accepts no responsibility to You or any Account holder for any fees imposed by an Account Provider. If the currency You select for Your transactions is not the currency in which an Account is denominated, the Account Provider may convert the funds at its own currency exchange rate or reject the transfers.\u0026nbsp; Your use of an Account must be limited to personal or individual use only and not for use by or on behalf of any business or legal entity. Western Union may use the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) network, book transfer, electronic funds transfer, wire transfer or other methods to process transactions relating to an Account. Western Union is not responsible for actions taken by the Account Provider, such as improperly posting the transactions.\u0026nbsp; The total due is payable before Western Union processes the transactions. If Western Union does not receive authorization from the Account Provider, the transactions will not be processed, and funds will not be transmitted to the Final Receiver. Each time You use your Account to pay for Services, You agree that Western Union is authorized to charge Your Account for the total disclosed to You relating to the transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp \u003e\u003cb\u003eIMPORTANT NOTICE FOR USING YOUR ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR THE TRANSACTIONS:\u003c/b\u003e\u0026nbsp;By initiating the transactions from an Account, You (i) affirm You are the owner of the Account and have authority to initiate the transaction and (ii) authorize Western Union to initiate electronic debits and credits to Your Account to process and correct errors and resubmit the debit or credit, according to applicable rules, if a transaction cannot be completed. Western Union may by law be liable for damages caused by its failure to debit Your Account in accordance with these terms and conditions, in the correct amount or in a timely manner when properly instructed by You. However, Western Union will not be liable where: (1) You do not have enough money available in Your Account; (2) Your Account is closed or withdrawals restricted; (3) the transaction exceeds dollar or frequency limitations imposed by Western Union or Your Account Provider; (4) circumstances beyond Western Union’s control (such as flood, fire, power outages, mechanical or system failures); (5) Your Account Provider does not honor the transactions, the transactions are not processed or the transactions are returned by Your Account Provider; (6) Your instructions are lost or delayed in transmission to Western Union; (7) Western Union fails to process your transactions because of a reasonable security concern or the Service option has been discontinued or suspended, or Western Union otherwise advises You that Your request will not be processed; and (8) other exceptions allowed by applicable law.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp \u003e\u003cb\u003e9.
